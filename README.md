Strategy Overview & Supporting Documentation

This repository presents a market-neutral, multi-strategy framework that combines mean reversion and momentum techniques across major FX pairs. The approach is designed to identify statistical mispricings and persistent trends through disciplined execution, diversification, and risk-controlled capital allocation.

The models are implemented in MetaTrader 5 and tested over five years of market data to validate robustness across regimes.
